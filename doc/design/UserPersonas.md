Citizen scientists watching climate change
Brief Description
Many governments and organizations provide estimates of the average global temperatures, but who watches over them? Citizen scientists and analytists routinely attempt to reproduce and verify the results and have the technical training and education to understand and even improve climate estimates. However, many don't have computer training and time to collect and corrolate data provided by the sources by various and uniquely different means and interfaces. Given proper tools to ease the data access task the citizen scientists/analytists can keep tabs on the watchers.

Actors
Citizen scientisits and analytists are people who are educated in science, technical, engineering, or mathematics and capable sophicated technical analyzes.

Preconditions
The citizen scientists are assume to be proficient with basic computer tasks and computational tools. However, no pacticular operatoring system, analysis tool, or programming language can be assumed. 

Basic Flow
* Open a self-documenting notebook type file
* Able to scroll through the file and see the data accessed and displayed
* Use simple, documented commands to re-executed the presented analysis
