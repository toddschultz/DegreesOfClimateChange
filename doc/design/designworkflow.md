## Workflow module for our project 
This project involves collecting estimates of the global average temperature from various agencies and comparing them for thier trends and finally, providing a notebook template for others to expand. Thus, the overall workflow for a finding, accessing, and using new sources of data will follow the same general work flow used to create the template notebook outlined below. 

1. Data Discovery: Discover and learn about a new data source offered by a creditable agency. 
2. Data Acquisition: Create a function to grab data from each of the data sources. 
3. Data wrangling: Transform and clean the raw data from each agency into a consistent format.  
4. Data Merging: This function will merge multiple (at least two ) data sources. 
5. Data Visualization: Visualize the data in ways that draws out insight from the individual trends and comparisons across the various agencies.  
6. Data Analysis: Explore any insights and trends of interest that have been discovered, applying additional analytical techniques and differing viewpoints. 
7. Conclusions: Provide conclusions that summarize the findings of the analysis and additional steps that may be of interest.
