NOAA
The average global temperature data seems to stored in an simple url interface at
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/

But only one month of the year can be accessed at a time but for the entire record from 1880 to present. The full url  is 
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series/globe/land_ocean/1/1/1880-2017.csv

The RESTful APIs don't seem to have the historic climate data including the global average temperature estimates.
