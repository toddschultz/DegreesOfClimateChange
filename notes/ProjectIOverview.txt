Degrees of (Climate) Change
scientific/social good, education and verification of climate data

The climate of the planet has been in continual flux throughout the ages. We know of ice ages that created glaciers miles thick, we know of tropical periods that allowed the dinosaur to flurish. Recent times have seen the industrial age create unseen wealth, prosparity, opportunity, and pollution. The evidence indicates that our pollution in disrupting the natural climate of the planet and causing a shift in the global temperatures. However, the people  of the world are divided on the interupation of the evidence not from differences in data or methods but because of political reasons and self-interest. The goal of this work is to create a simple comparison of various estimates of the average global temperature. 
Although, ultimately all estimates of the average global temperature are based on the same pool of global temperature observations, the comparison is insightful to verify the processing applied by each source such as selection of observations and computational processing. 

Use case
Name – Citizen scientists watching climate change
Brief Description
Many governments and organizations provide estimates of the average global temperatures, but who watches over them? Citizen scientists and analytists routinely attempt to reproduce and verify the results and have the technical training and education to understand and even improve climate estimates. However, many don't have computer training and time to collect and corrolate data provided by the sources by various and uniquely different means and interfaces. Given proper tools to ease the data access task the citizen scientists/analytists can keep tabs on the watchers.

Actors
Citizen scientisits and analytists are people who are educated in science, technical, engineering, or mathematics and capable sophicated technical analyzes.

Preconditions
The citizen scientists are assume to be proficient with basic computer tasks and computational tools. However, no pacticular operatoring system, analysis tool, or programming language can be assumed. 

Basic Flow
* Open a self-documenting notebook type file
* Able to scroll through the file and see the data accessed and displayed
* Use simple, documented commands to re-executed the presented analysis
* Able to modified or extent the analysis

Alternate Flows – Capture the less common user/system interactions, such as being on a new computer and answering a security question.
Exception Flows – The things that can happen that prevent the user from achieving their goal, such as providing an incorrect username and password.
Post Conditions – Anything that must be true when the use case is complete.
